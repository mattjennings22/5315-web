      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open-source system that allows users to bundle efficient containers of software onto a machine. The bundle will contain only what is necessary to run the software, so it does not take long to download and does not take up much space. This software can then be used in the terminal to run certain applications that are useful for development projects. Another benefit is that it allows for version control and compatibility across different languages, making sure that Docker and its packages will work across different machines.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is open source software used to create a web server. The main benefit of using Nginx is that it can handle a high volume of requests at the same time. Similar to Docker, it delivers high speed performance in a lightweight package. Apache was the dominant platform in this market for many years, but eventually it started to slow down due to the C10K problem (lots of connections to a server at one time). Nginx was designed with this problem in mind and does a better job of creating an event-driven architecture that can handle larger loads.
